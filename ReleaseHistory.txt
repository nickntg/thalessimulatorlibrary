ThalesSim Release History
=========================

2010/06/16: Version 0.9 beta released.
--------------------------------------
* The message parsing mechanism for host commands has been completely redesigned
  in order to use XML configuration files. The goal is to provide both greater
  flexibility and easier creation when implementing new and/or complex host
  commands.
* Fixed a bug where the DC command returned a DE response instead of DD.
* Added a console version of the simulator.
* Implemented EMV Key Derivation Method B, added it to the PM command.
* The following host commands have been added:
    - BI (Generate a BDK).
    - DE (Generate an IBM offset).
    - CI (Translate PIN from DUKPT to ZPK.
    - CK (Verify a DUKPT PIN using the VISA method).
    - CM (Verify a DUKPT PIN using the IBM method).
    - EA (Verify an interchange PIN using the IBM method).
    - DA (Verify a terminal PIN using the IBM method).

2010/04/23: Version 0.8.6 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Fixed a bug which caused check values generated from console commands
  to be displayed incorrectly.
* Added redistributable setup project.
* Fixed a bug at the EC console command that prevented use of double and
  triple length keys.
* Added the following host commands:
    - B2 (echo test).
    - BC (Verify a terminal PIN using the comparison method).
    - BE (Verify an interchange PIN using the comparison method).
    - NK (Command chaining).
* Updated some message handling classes to use generics instead of array
  lists.
* Tentatively added support for running under Mono 2.6.3. At this stage,
  a build script under Mono is not provided. Instead, the complete solution
  must be build under Windows using VS.2008 and resulting binaries should
  be copied to Linux for execution using Mono. The sole working distribution
  under which this was tested was openSUSE 11.2.
* An alternative configuration file has been added for use with Mono 2.6.3.
  This file contains key/value pairs with the simulator parameters and is
  alternatively read if there is a problem parsing the XML file.

2009/12/07: Version 0.8.5 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Added an implementation of the PM - Verify dynamic CVV command. Currently, the command
  is working only when:
    - the scheme ID refers to MasterCard PayPass,
    - the key derivation method refers to Option A,
    - the command is supplied with the PAN and track data.
* Added an implementation of the GM command - Hash a block of data. Currently,
  the command does not support the ISO 10118-2 and SHA-224 hash algorithms.
* Added the following console commands:
    - N (single-length DES calculator).
    - $ (double-length DES calculator).
    - T (triple-length DES calculator).

2009/11/19: Version 0.8.4 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Fixed an error in ValidateKeySchemeAndLength which resulted in returning all double length
  keys encrypted with the variant method.
* Fixed an error where multi-component messages didn't have their components pushed to the stack.
* Any exceptions that are thrown by console commands are now caught and the exception error
  is returned to the console instead of simply dropping the console TCP connection.
* Empty messages can now be received by the TCP socket.
* Added an ExtendedValidator for console command implementations. This allows to chain a series
  of validators and perform several checks in sequence.
* Added the ability to copy and paste at the console window.
* Added the following console commands:
    - EC (encrypt clear component).
    - KG (generate a key).
    - IK (imports a key).
    - KE (exports a key).
    - F (generate a ZMK component).
    - Z (encrypt a clear ZMK component).
    - D (form ZMK from encrypted components).

2009/11/15: Version 0.8.3 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Fixed a parity error bug that occured when using double and triple length length keys with commands
  that translated from ZPK to LMK encryption (wiki item 70958).
* Fixed a bug in the WorkerClient class that prevented correct transmission of string data.
* Added the capability to accept and execute console commands. This is done by listening to another 
  TCP port for commands typed-in by a user. The following commands are now implemented:
    - A (enter the authorized state).
    - C (cancel the authorized state).
    - QA (query auxilliary).
    - QC (query console).
    - QH (query host).
    - VR (version number).
    - GC (generate key component).
* Added a new console form in the Windows client simulator.

2009/06/15: Version 0.8.2 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Added the ThalesPVVClashingDemo utility. This is used to demonstrate the existence of multiple PINs per card.
  Note that this is not always valid for all cards/PINs. 
* Fixed a bug in Utility.RandomKey method that created invalid length keys.
* Dumped the reflection code in WorkerClient and used the Client.RemoteEndPoint.String method to return the client IP.
* Fixed a bug in LMKStorage.ReadLMKs method that caused the simulator to incorrectly read existing keys.
* The simulator now uses the Invoke method to write to the text boxes on the UI thread.

2009/03/08: Version 0.8.1 beta released.
----------------------------------------

* Converted code to use generics.
* Added Windows service and setup projects.

2009/03/01: Version 0.8 beta released.
--------------------------------------

* Ported to .Net 3.5, VS 2008. The code has not been reworked at all to take advantage of 3.5 available functionality, this will be taken care of in the next release. NUnit test cases have been removed in favor of VS 2008 testing unit framework. NDoc dependency has been removed. The Windows Service and setup will be re-added in the next release.

2006/06/15: Version 0.7 beta released.
--------------------------------------

* New implemented command: HC.
* GUI key type table implemented in simulator executable. 

2006/06/12: Version 0.6 released.
---------------------------------

* New implemented commands: FI, FK, FM, MA, MC, ME, MQ. 

2006/06/11: Version 0.5 released.
---------------------------------

* New implemented commands: AS, CW, CY, AU, AW.
* Added new field parser method (field type VariableLengthUntilDelimiter) to facilitate parsing of variable fields whose end is signaled by a following delimiter. 

2006/06/10: Version 0.4.3 released.
-----------------------------------

* Added initial version of the simulator service and related installer.

2006/06/07: Version 0.4.2 released.
-----------------------------------

* Added initial version of the simulator executable.
* Changed command explorer to ignore multiple classes that implement the same Thales command.

2006/06/05: Version 0.4.1 released.
-----------------------------------

* New classes TranslateFromLMKToKey, TranslateFromKeyToLMK and NoImplementation are inherited by several commands that used similar functionality.
* Initial project overview documentation added.

2006/06/04: Version 0.4 released.
---------------------------------

* New implemented commands: HA, AE, FC, FE, MI, MG, AG.
* Added code to allow DES encrypt/decrypt using a DES weak key. The .Net crypto implementation throws an exception when a DES weak key is used in an encrypt or decrypt operation. Although this is simply good practice, it prevents someone from using the standard LMK test suite. The library now logs a major warning when a weak key is encountered.

2006/06/03: Version 0.3 released.
---------------------------------

* New implemented commands: GY, BY, FA, GC, IA, OE, FG.
* Fixed improper termination of TCP listening thread.

2006/05/29: Version 0.2.1 released.
-----------------------------------

* Minor update, added NUnit test cases.

2006/05/28: Version 0.2 released.
---------------------------------

* New implemented commands: BQ, CA, CC, DC, DG, EC, JA, JC, JE, JG.
* Fixed bugs relating to construction and decomposition of Diebold and Docutel PIN block formats.
* After some rethink, Log4Net is dropped in favor of the current event system. Log4Net may be incorporated into the final simulator executable.

2006/05/25: Version 0.1 released.
----------------------------------

This is the initial version of the library. It contains the initial implementation of a lot of things like cryptography, LMK storage, message parsing methods, host command base class and implementation of several Thales commands, TCP/IP worker class, logic to parse key schemes, key types and other stuff. The only real way to get into the library is to get into the code.
